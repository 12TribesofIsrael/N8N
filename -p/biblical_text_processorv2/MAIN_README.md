## 🧠 **The Core Logic**

### **Intelligent Processing Pipeline**
```
Large Biblical Text (Any Size)
          ↓
    Text Cleaning & Normalization
    • Remove verse references
    • Normalize spacing/formatting
    • Preserve core biblical content
          ↓
    Smart Segmentation Algorithm
    • Break into ~1000-word sections
    • Find optimal sentence boundaries
    • Maintain context across sections
          ↓
    Professional Formatting
    • Add section headers with metrics
    • Calculate video time estimates
    • Generate scene count predictions
          ↓
    Multiple Video-Ready Sections
    • Each optimized for 5-7 minute videos
    • Immediate use with video generators
    • Professional presentation ready
```

### **Advanced Text Processing Features**

#### **1. Intelligent Text Cleaning**
```python
# Removes biblical formatting that interferes with video processing:
• Verse references: "Deuteronomy 4:7-8" → Clean content
• Section headers: "THE MOST HIGH CHOSEN PEOPLE" → Removed
• Precept references: "Precepts to Deuteronomy 4:7:" → Cleaned
• Multiple spaces/line breaks → Normalized single spaces
• Standalone verse numbers → Removed
```

#### **2. Smart Boundary Detection**
```python
# Finds optimal breaking points:
• Target: 1000 words per section
• Boundary rule: Must end at complete sentence
• Context preservation: 70% minimum content retention
• Flow maintenance: Smooth transitions between sections
```

#### **3. Professional Output Formatting**
```python
# Each section includes:
• Word count: Exact count for video planning
• Video estimate: Based on 150 words per minute
• Scene prediction: Based on 40 words per scene
• Clear separators: Easy copy/paste for video generation
```
